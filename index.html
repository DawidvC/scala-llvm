  <h1>Scala on LLVM</h1>
  <p>
  This site will be the main location for information about the LLVM backend for Scala that is under development by Geoff Reedy.
  </p>
  <h1>The Code</h1>
  The code is being developed on <a href="http://github.com/greedy/scala">github</a>.

  <h2>Compiling Scala to LLVM</h2>
  <p>
  This is our submission to the Second Scala Workshop to be held at Stanford on June 2nd 2011. Note the the paper has not been accepted yet but is posted here for feedback and discussion.

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <blockquote>
    This paper describes ongoing work to implement a new backend for the Scala
    compiler that targets the <i>Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)</i>.  LLVM
    aims to provide a universal intermediate representation for compilers to
    target and a framework for program transformations and analyses. LLVM also
    provides facilities for ahead-of-time and just-in-time native code
    generation. Targeting LLVM allows us to take advantage of this framework to
    compile Scala source code to optimized native executables. We discuss the
    design and implementation of our backend. We also outline the additional
    work needed to produce a robust backend.
